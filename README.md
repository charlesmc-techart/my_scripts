# Personal Scripts

The files here are contained in my personal [configs directory](https://github.com/charlesmc-techart/MyConfigs.git) that contains the module `link.zsh`, which is required by the `install` scripts. The `link.zsh` module dictates how the scripts and config files are placed in their respective locations.

## `organize_directory`

A CLI script originally intended to organize my Downloads folder

## `process_screenshots`

A script that is executed by a Folder Action on MacOS. It renames and adds certain metadata to screenshots taken on my computer
